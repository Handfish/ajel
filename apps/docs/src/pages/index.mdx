# ajel (Asynchronous JavaScript Error Library)

## Why I ported Golang's most hated feature to JavaScript

As I entered yet another year of employment at my current company, I was tasked with a new goal.
I wanted to learn something new. A little mustached Netflix birdie told me to dig one level deeper.
I told myself it was time to stop being a lowly TS soy dev, and alas, I had a brief but impactful
affair with the oxidized language Rust. As work demands kicked into overdrive during the busy portion of the year,
I returned to Typescript land with my new experience with Result types - and I saw nothing but holes everywhere.


It greatly bothered me that I had never fully considered how to properly handle errors in my code. Thus began my
exploration of the topic.
It was not hard to narrow down the source of the problem. `try/catch` is a terrible way to handle errors. The `throw` keyword is
not included in the type system, and thus, it is not possible to know what errors a function can throw.

I tried a few different approaches. Result-type libraries felt like trying to force Rust's paradigm into a language that
wasn't designed for it. I wanted to find a way to make it work with the language, not against it.
Out of the solutions I tried, [one of them felt right.](https://dev.to/karanpratapsingh/go-like-error-handling-in-typescript-4plm#comment-1hc45)
I had found a way that worked for me. And so, I decided to make a library out of it.

## What is ajel?

Ajel is a **133 byte** library that allows you to handle errors in a way that is similar to Golang.
`ajel` is a simple function that consumes a promise and returns a tuple represetning the result and the error.
On success, the result item has value. On error, the error item has value. It's that simple.

```typescript
import { ajel } from 'ajel';

async function main() {
  const [result, err] = await ajel(Promise.resolve('hello world'));

  if (err) {
    return err;
  }

  return result;
}
```


More interestingly, it comes with a series of linting tools to help enforce the paradigm.
