# Aliasing `ajel`

When picking a name for `ajel` I made sure to pick a beautiful chord to type. However, I understand that some people may not like the name `ajel` and may want to alias it to something else.
I may recommend the name [blimpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VOnKMJqIL0) as it is also a beautiful chord to type. If you want to alias `ajel` to a different name, you can do so by passing the `ajelAlias` option to the rules you want to use.

This example `.eslintrc.js` shows how to alias `ajel` to a different name. Providing an alias to these rules will produce the proper in-editor hints and expected functionality from the linter.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['ajel'],
  extends: [
    'plugin:ajel/recommended',
  ],
  rules: {
    'ajel/ajel-disable-try-catch': [
      'error',
      {
        ajelAlias: 'blimpy',
        sjelAlias: "limpyb",
      },
    'ajel/ajel-strict-error-instanceof': [
      'off',
      {
        ajelAlias: 'blimpy',
        sjelAlias: "limpyb",
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

Then use the rename function in the import statement.

```javascript
import { ajel as blimpy, sjel as limpyb } from 'ajel';
```
