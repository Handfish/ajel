# Other Error Handling Considerations
 
## Use ajel with unsafe code

`ajel` (and `try catch`) should be utilized when dealing with code that utilizes `throw`.

It is used as a way to capture the `unknown` return which is not denoted by the return-type.


## Consider not using ajel with internal code (not throwing)

Most applications do not need to throw. 

When maintaining your own app, consider returning  instead. You can return an error if you need a stack trace,
or return a string with an error name or code - ie `ERR103-FileNotFound`.
